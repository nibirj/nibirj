### Hello, my name is Nikita Birjukovs 👋  

I am a second-year student of computer science at TalTech 📚.  

I speak Russian, Estonian and English 3️⃣.  

I have some experience in web development (front-end and back-end) 💻.  

Also I know: Java 📙, Python 🐍, PHP ➿, JavaScript🟧, Node.js 🎒, Spring 🟩, Angular🅰️.  

During my university studies I have encountred many difficulties which have made me realise that there is no such thing as an unsolvable problem but rather that it is only a matter of time for me to find a solution.  💪🏻
