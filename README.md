### Hello, my name is Nikita Birjukovs  

I am a third-year student of computer science at TalTech.  

I speak Russian, Estonian and English.  

I have some experience in web development (front-end and back-end).  

I have basic knowledge: Java, Python, PHP, JavaScrip, Node.js, Spring, Angular, Vue.  

During my university studies I have encountred many difficulties which have made me realise that there is no such thing as an unsolvable problem but rather that it is only a matter of time for me to find a solution.
